Spring Quiz 2:


1. Java Server Pages handle views and inject data and logic into HTML responses
Answer : True

2. We use JSTL tags to dynamically populate our templates with data from the server.
Answer : True

3. In order to render a JSP file, we use the @RestController annotation.
Answer : False (@RestController annotaion used to return a String or jason object ,we use @Controller to render our jsp file)

4. Model objects use key-value pairs to pass data to our view.
Answer:True

5. Model objects automatically pass all variables to our view.
Answer:False 

( whenever you import Model object into your controller you can use it as a container
 to store data and pass that data to the view engine. Data can be any type: objects, strings, numbers, even dates! And you can use it in any of your method signatures. When the framework gets a request mapped to that function, it will automatically create that Model instance container, the model variable in our code below. 
This is an example of dependency injection.)
