Annotations Used:


* @OneToOne: Defines the 1:1 relationship with another entity. There are different options that you can have in the annotation, and it is extremely important that you use the correct one depending on which side of the relationship your entity is.

* @OneToOne(mappedBy="person"): This will map the license attribute in the Person class

 that owns the relationship. This element is only specified on the inverse
 (non-owning) side of the association.

* @OneToOne(cascade=CascadeType.ALL): The operations that must be cascaded 
 to the target of the association. This will make sure referential integrity 
 is preserved in ALL actions.

 or must be eagerly fetched.

* LAZY: The association is fetched when needed

* EAGER: The association is fetched immediately.

 to the referenced table.
